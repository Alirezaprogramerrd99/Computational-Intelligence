- ### How do i run code ? 
  - You can run cells using shift + enter or shift + ctrl 
- ### How do i upload my data sets to colaboratory ? 
  - You can upload data like csv files to your google drive and mount or download from it in code 
  - example code will be given ! 
- ### How do i speed up training time ? 
  - You can change your runtime from CPU to GPU or TPU at the top 
  - You will especially need this option when training on image type data 
- ### How to make my code clean so i can debug it later and to get extra points ? 
  - split code into subroutines (functions) 
  - consider using wrapper functions when using libraries  
  - define only one function in each cell 
  - make use of functional programming concepts to keep your code clean (pure functions)
  - use a naming convention and stay consistent with it
